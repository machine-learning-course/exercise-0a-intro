# Exercise 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

This README.md file contains an overview of this exercise.
The purpose of this exercise is to introduce you to GitHub and fundamental machine learning concepts.

This repository also contains sample data in CSV format (`sample1.csv`).

You may submit your assignment using one of the following formats:

1. Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) -- recommended, this way you can run your program while also documenting how it works right around the code
2. Office Word (`.docx`) or LibreOffice (`.odt`)
3. Markdown (`.md`)

Plus the source code and executable if needed.
